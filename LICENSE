The original software by Adafruit at
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_FocalTouch/blob/main/adafruit_focaltouch.py
is extensively modified/extended by bachipeachy@gmail.com to add additional features and
tested exclusively on M5Stack Core 2 Hardware. Software may be adopted for other hardware.
The enhanced features include:
1) Support for swipe gestures -- 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN' in addition to
2) Support for touch gestures -- "TAP" and "HELD" gestures for a single touch opeqrtion
3) Support for tunable parameters for various gestures to address granularity and speed of response.

Although, the FocalTouch FT-62XX advertizes support for multitouch, it seems, at least on
M5Stack Core2 test hardware multi-touch (two finger gestures) does not work satisfatorily as a
result multtouch gestures such as pinch, expand, rotate could not be implemented.
The multitouch sensor seems to work correctly for changes in 'y' co-ordinates but did not responsd for 'x'.
